## ANTICIPATE THESE QUESTIONS

**Q1**: Why can't established players (Jagran Josh) do this?
**A**: They're focused on news/content, not specialized automation. Our moat is 500+ custom scrapers + focused UX.

**Q2**: What if Google changes algorithm?
**A**: Multi-domain strategy + focus on user engagement metrics + white-hat SEO only.

**Q3**: What if AdSense rejects/suspends?
**A**: Multiple domains with separate accounts + backup monetization (Ezoic, Mediavine) + strict policy compliance.

**Q4**: Why not sell courses like everyone else?
**A**: Focus. Pure media play has higher margins (95% vs 60-70%), scales better, no customer support overhead.

**Q5**: How defensible is this?
**A**: 18-24 months to build domain authority + 500+ scrapers + traffic compounding = high barrier to entry.

**Q6**: What's your customer acquisition cost?
**A**: ₹0. 100% organic traffic from Google search and Discover.

**Q7**: What if traffic doesn't grow as projected?
**A**: Conservative projections already built in. Even 50% of target (₹5Cr/month) is profitable business.

**Q8**: How hands-on do you need to be?
**A**: First 6 months: Very hands-on. After 12 months: 95% automated, management only.
