## 11. REVENUE PROJECTION (International Module)

### Conservative Estimates

**Year 1 (After Launch)**:
```
Month 8:  1M page views × ₹300 RPM = ₹3L
Month 12: 2M page views × ₹350 RPM = ₹7L
Month 18: 5M page views × ₹400 RPM = ₹20L
Month 24: 10M page views × ₹400 RPM = ₹40L
```

**Combined with Domestic**:
```
Month 24:
Domestic exams:    500M PVs × ₹200 = ₹10Cr
International:     10M PVs × ₹400 = ₹40L
TOTAL:             510M PVs = ₹10.4Cr/month
```

**Incremental Revenue**: +₹40L/month (4% increase)

**ROI**:
- Additional investment: ₹20L (development + data)
- Monthly return: ₹40L
- ROI: 2x per month after ramp-up

---

## 12. CROSS-PROMOTION STRATEGY

### Synergies with Domestic Content

**User Journey**:
```
Student searches: "UPSC result 2026"
↓
Lands on ExamForms.org
↓
Sees related link: "Study abroad scholarships"
↓
Discovers international opportunities
↓
Both domestic and international pages visited
```

**Internal Linking**:
- From UPSC result page: "Didn't qualify? Explore international scholarships"
- From JEE result page: "Study engineering abroad with scholarships"
- From NEET page: "MBBS abroad: scholarships and opportunities"

**Content Bridges**:
- "After graduation: Study abroad options"
- "MBA abroad vs MBA in India"
- "PhD in India vs PhD abroad with funding"

---

## 13. IMPLEMENTATION PRIORITY

**Month 6**: Planning & Research

**Month 7**: Development

---

## 14. RISKS & MITIGATION

### Risk 1: Complex Data
**Challenge**: Scholarship criteria complex and varied

### Risk 2: Update Frequency
**Challenge**: Annual cycles, less frequent updates
**Mitigation**: Focus on deadline tracking, yearly refresh cycles

### Risk 3: Language Barriers
**Challenge**: Non-English sources
**Mitigation**: Translation tools, hire native language speakers if needed

### Risk 4: Lower Traffic Volume
**Challenge**: Smaller market than domestic exams
**Mitigation**: Higher RPM compensates, premium positioning

---
